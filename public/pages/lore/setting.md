## The Empire of Ellydor

Named after Ellydor the wealthy, who ruled Elysium, the Ruby City in the age of prosperity.

The dwarves dug deep into the the mountains of the Belt of the World, to drag up wealth beyond imagination. Soon the world learned it is not love, honor or steel that rules the world but gold. As Ellydor bough allegiances from the neighboring kingdoms, the civilized world soon learned that is better to bend the knee to Ellydor, than to fight and die. And so begun the rule of the dwarves.

Centuries later the age of prosperity has ended, the heart of the mountain is bleed dry. The dynasty of the dwarves remain but it is weakened, so much that the wild races crossed the frozen desert during the last long summer to invade. Though their invasion failed, it has weakened the position of the dwarves. Now the emperor fears that his own people is plotting against him, under the veil of fighting corruption noble families have had their heads impaled on spikes for display. The commoners have given a name for the emperor, only spoken in whispers, Fladvik the Mad.

The Empire of Ellydor is built on the magical power of Dragonshards. Dragonshards are crystals imbued with raw mystical energy. They are the fuel that drives the magical economy, playing a vital role in the creation of magic items and the performance of arcane rituals.

## The Wild Races

In contrast to the Empire of Ellydor stands the Wild Races, a losely organized group of the humanoid races from the Far Lands. Realatively little is known of their society, as Svelljord, the frozen desert, seperates their lands from the Empire of Ellydor.

The unforgiving cold and barren lands of the frozen desert makes traveling from Ellydor to the Farlands an almost impossible task. Were it not for the natural phenomen of long summers almost no one would cross this desert. Long summers come around only once per generation and last for a few years, during which Svelljord melts and becomes a fertile land.

Twenty years ago durig the last long summer the wild races launched a invasion into Ellydor, but it was a small long summer lasting only two years. So as Svelljord begun to freeze over the wild races were forced to retreat to avoid being cut of from their supply lines.

The wild races are unfamiliar with Dragonshards, this combined with the fact that all known Dragonshards come from the belt of the world, leads people to believe that there are no Dragonshards beyond Svelljord. With no access to Dragonshards to fuel their more powerful magic, the Wild Races use a Shamanistic sacrifical ritual magic.
