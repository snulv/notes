>Bardic tales describe this valley, enclosed by mountains, to have been a battlefield between ancient stone giants and the gods in times long past. The landscape is dotted with big rocks and boulders that are said to have been used by the giants as ammunition to throw at the gods. There are some oddly shaped hills in the far east that are rumoured to be the remains of a slain stone giant.
