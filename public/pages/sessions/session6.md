# Session 6

Early the following morning John Parsons and his son had come to bid the group farewell, as the A-Squad departed Stonewood togethes with Filibert Silentfoot. 

The group traveled about six hours in the direction of Fortunas before they encountered two dwarven merchants named Huginn and Muninn, whom tried to sell various wares. To late the group realize that it was a trap set by the emperor's guard and the dwarves unleased fire upon the group.

The group faught valiantly, but as the dwarves called in reinforcements they where forced to retreat. The group was chased several hours through the woods before the Emperor's guard lost their trail.

Off their original trail the group was left with two choices, should they continue traveling north to Fortunar potentially encountering the Emperor's guard again or should they travel south to Nivershaw hoping to find passage to Slumberhaven by boat. The group decided to travel south and after a short wait they were able to find passage to Slumberhaven by boat, traveling with a captain by the name of Captain Windbloom.

After a day of travel across restless seas the group landed in Slumberhaven. They asked around trying to orient themselves in the town. After a while they got to talking with the Captain of the Towns Guard Jon Thorn, a former member of the towns guard of Kawloon. He told the group about a mysterious wizard that lives in a lighthouse on a island outside of town, and about the ruins of an old wizards college located on another island further out into the sea.

Intrigued about the wizard and seeking further knowledge about the Eldritch Machine in their posession the group decided to seek out the wizard.

When the group arrived at the lighthouse they where greeted by a wizard named Aldaron. He hinted that he had more information about the Eldritch machine that he would reveal to the players if they would travel to the old wizards college and retrieve a book for him. The A-Squad accepted.
