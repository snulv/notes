# Session 5

When the A-Squad arrived at the Miller's mill they decided that the best course of action was to lay a trap and wait for Gordon Wheatfallow. After a couple of hours spent setting up they were ready settled down to guard the area. Just past midnight their plan seemed to be a success as a person that seemed to be Gordon appeared heading for the mill with a torch. In an amazing feat of cooperation the group was able to tackle him to the ground without giving him a chance to react.

Their suspicions where quickly confirmed as the person was in fact Gordon Wheatfallow and he was carrying a large amount of Shadowspark. The group arranged with John Parsons that Gordon would be placed in arrest for the time being. As the group headed to the tavern to rest.

The morning after the group was greeted in the tavern main room by John Parsons, he wanted the A-Squad to follow him to the town guard's main quarters to help him interrogate Anton Miller and Gordon Wheatfallow. But as they left the tavern they where abushed by the Illusionist from earlier. The A-Squad had a short exchange with an illusion, where the illusionist had blamed the humans for cursing themselves and his people. As the illusion dissapeared the illusionist revealed his true location to be on the other side of the market.

The illusionist deactivated his disguise belt to reveal his true form, a hobgoblin shaman covered in ritualistic tattoos. As he sliced a skin over his tattoos a bloody mist was released driving some nearby guards into a frenzy attacking the A-Squad. However due to the desperate situation of the illusionist this was no match for the A-Squad and they promtly dispatched with the illusionist.

After the fight the group picked up a strange inert eldrich machine filled with ritualistic markings from the body of the illusionist. John Parsons departed asking the A-Squad to come meet him in a couple of hours.   

The group celebrated the death of the illusionist in the tavern as Filbert Silentfoot arrived. He revealed to the A-Squad that they had been right in assuming that the temple of Kensington and Stonewood was connected. There seems to have been some sort of ritual performed by royal clerics in these three temples just at the end of the last war. The temple of Kensinton, Stonewood and Slumberhaven, however he has yet to figure out the nature of the ritual. It seems as if the ritual has been struck from the official records, and the only proof that it even happened lies in stories told by the people that were there.

Silentfoot said to the group that he would depart Stonewood in the morning, as he believes that Stonewood is no longer in danger. He said he would be traveling to the town of Westwend, and that the A-Squad should come meet him there. He hinted that he would reveal the nature of the organization he works for if they arrive there.

Later the group arrived at the town guard quarters to talk with John Parsons. John informed the group that him and the town of Stonewood are forever in depth to the A-Squad, and as far as they are concerned they are loyal to them over some emperor they never see. However he had recently recieved a wanted poster for the A-Squad. Parsons told the group that the guards and people of Stonewood would never try to apprehend them, but they could also not fight any emperors guards that entered town, as that would be the end of the town. For their own safety the A-Squad should depart Stonewood tomorrow, since their location is now surly known to the Emperor's Guard. However they could return as soon as the emperor's guard had lost their trail.

To thank the A-Squad the people of Stonewood had decided to give the property in the middle of the inheritance dispute to the A-Squad, and that Parsons would personally make sure their property was properly managed in their absence. In addition the people how Stonewood had scraped together some magical equipment for the A-Squad. Though not powerful equipment, it had been especially selected for each of the members.

As the A-Squad retreated to their property for a final nights sleep before departing, they were greeted by the citizens of Stonewood as Heroes. Tired but satisfied the group went to bed.

*Tomorrow will be a bright new day*
