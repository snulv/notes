# Session 14

The A-Squad's plan to set a trap to lure the Empire's Guards chasing them into the sewers seemed to be a success. They recieved information that they would be charging their base the following day. So the A-Squad started to make a plan, and through the help of the resistance they were ready for the Empire's Guard.

The following day the A-Squad was waiting for the Guards in the sewers, the initial charge was stopped by Lewis polymorphed into a giant ape throwing explosives at them. Soon after a second charge was launched, but bye releasing water stored behind a dam allowed the group to retreat into a room for their defensive stance.

The room's narrow entry point and high ground allowed the group a perfect situation for a fight against superior numbers. Edward was knocked out by a rain of arrows, but thanks to their superior position the group was able to bring down the intruders.

After the fight the group was approached by an illusion of one of the leader's of the guards. He applauded their plan, but taunted that the next time the tides would be turned. He then revealed that he was in possession of the final eldritch machine.

The illusion retreated and the group returned to Helm Graycastle that informed them that tomorrow would be the day of the revolution, and that they will be taking the town of Westwend tomorrow. 

After the talk with Helm, the group recieved a letter from their potion apprentice Islay in Stonewood. The letter contained the following
    
>This week has been exceptionally good for me, so I've been able to make a profit while also producing your surplus potions. Having access to my own work area has propelled my skill level and I am starting to build a name for your establishment.
>
>On another note, something strange happened the other day. An old lady named Olga approached me just before closing time, and said that she had helped you out with a powerful potion at a very affordable price when you needed it the most, and she was hoping you would be willing to assist her now.
>
>She asked me to get pay for very rare materials of the market for her and in return she would teach me how to create a powerful potion from the materials. I thought maybe she was a trying to scam me into buying the materials for her, but after having done further research I have become intrigued over what potion they could be used to make.
>
>Since this is your establishment I will leave the choice to you. The materials will cost us one week of profit and she said she would return 5 days, so I require an answer quickly.


The group returned a message to Islay, saying the accepted the proposition.
