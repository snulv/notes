# Session 11

After a late night of discussion the A-Squad decided to join the resistance, before going  to bed. When the awoke in the morning they noticed the Hans Clock was missing. Curious about the location of their squad member, they contacted Helm Graycastle, the leader of the resistance.

The groups was informed that Hans had decided to abandon the group and remain loyal to the empire. A situation that had put the resistance a situation where the would have to act fast. Their position in the sewers was crucial to their next mission and they would have to move now, in case Hans should compromise their position.

The A-Squad was asked to travel through the sewers and a portion of the Underdark that would connect them to the city's prison. Their mission would be to free some merchants of the black marked. This would  hopefully gain the resistance the favor of the common people, crucial for further success. And hopefully the merchants would supply the resistance with much needed gold and equipment in turn. A companying the A-Squad would be Silentfoot and a nun of the silver flame named Alice.

Such a bold move would surely catch the attention of the emperor, which would likely send reinforcements to stop the resistance before they would have a chance to move. So to delay the reinforcements, Helm Graycastle would lead another team to sabotage the lightrail leading to Westwend.

After a quick walk through the sewer the group arrived at a narrow cave entrance to the Underdark. At the other end of the narrow cave the underdark opened up into a vast underground chasm, several thousand feet deep. The group made their way deeper into the darkness, following a ledge on the chasm side, until they arrived upon a cave leading away from the chasm.

This cave would lead the group to the sewers below the prison. However between them and the prison a group of Kobolds had decided to settle down. The group was unable to pass the fiercely territorial kobolds undetected and were forced to fight them. Even though the Kobolds fought well, they proved no match for the group.
  
Just beyond the Kobold camp the group arrived sewers under the prison. To prepare in case of a swift retreat Alwyn decided to rig the some of the pipe systems in the sewers, so that he could make them blow up later. And after an encounter with a sentient Ooze the group arrived at the entrance to the prison.

Keeping a low profile, the group was able to find the prisoners without alerting the guards. And through some creative distraction using a bad of tricks and invisibility magic the group was able to get the key and free the prisoners without having to use violence.

Retreating back into the sewers and further out through the cave, the group became aware of the fact that they were being chased. Detonating the contraption rigged by Alwyn they were able to get enough distance between themselves and their pursuers to escape into the Underdark chasm without much problem.

After traveling along the ledge of the chasm they once again entered the narrow cave. As the group entered the narrow cave they heard a sound of falling rock, as the group turned around they saw the last person, Silentfoot, being pulled of the ground and into the chasm. On the other side of the chasm they saw Hans catching Bakrus as it returned to his hand. The sides of the narrow cave distorted the groups vision as Hans stepped to one side. The group attempted to regain vision of him, but the darkness and his cloak made him impossible to see.

The group contemplated chasing after Hans or searching the chasm for Silentfoot, however the sound of the guards chasing them coming closer forced them to retreat out of the sewers.

Once out of the sewers Alice lead the group to a resistance safe house, were the group decided to lay low for the rest of the day.
