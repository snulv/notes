# Session 2

 After a night of drinking in the tavern The A-Squad was awakened by someone entering their room in the morning. A slightly odd Halfling with an amazing southern accent, named Filibert Silentfoot.

After a short introduction it became clear that Silentfoot was the one that had asked them to Stonewood. Siltenfoot works in an organization that deals in information, through their dealing they had come in touch with information that the A-Squad was innocent and that Stonewood was the next target. Whoever is behind framing the A-Squad seems to have been working in the shadows to destabilize Kensington before attacking the killing the inhabitants.

Being afraid that Stonewood would be destabilize before an coming attack the A-Squad agreed investigate any potential attempts of doing this. While this happened Silentfoot would work from the shadows attempting to find more information. To allow for communication between the two groups Silentfoot gave the A-Squad a communication stone.

After talking with the Old Man that was stabbed the previous day, it became clear that Stonewood is currently in the middle of a family feude between the Wheatfallows and the Miller families, regarding a inherritance of a prime location marked house. Because of this the Wheatfallows believe the Millers to be behind the stabbing.

The A-Squad sought out the Mill house, where they were promptly attacked by a group of infiltrators, one of which was an illusionist. The infiltrators were defeated but the illusionist got away. After discovering that the attackers where Hobgoblins desguised as humans the Miller patriarch Anton confronted the players. He believes that he was the intended target of the attack and that this attack was a part of a bigger conspiracy. After he rushed off to talk with the leader of the town guard the A-Squad decided to search his house for any helpful information. The only thing they discovered that a person named Gordon Wheatfallow has been seen lurking around the Mill last night.

After a some investigation around Stonewood the A-squad discovered that Gordon Wheatfallow is the town drunk and that he hasn't been seen at his local drinking hole for a while. A quick search of his bed chamber revealed some Shadowspark a herb that produces an unusually long lasting flame when lit.

The A-squad called up Silentfoot and shared their findings with him. Silentfoot believes that the Hobgoblins are likely behind the conspiracy, but he is unsure of their motivation. He did however reveal that he had found the location of the bandit group behind the stabbing, furthermore he had discovered that the attack was indeed hired by someone else.

The A-Squad promptly departed into the forest to find the Bandit Camp. Silentfoot remained in the town promising to contact the squad by the communication stone if there was an emergency.

Upon traveling into the forest the group encountered a lively satyr native to the area. After a light exchange of music, alcohol and elvish conversation the satyr promised to show the A-quad to the bandit camp by an extremelly quick path, if they in return would attempt to return his Camembert that was stolen by the bandits.

Just as the sun was setting the A-Squad came upon a bandit camp surrounded by wooden pillars. The sound of lively discussion from around the campfires filled the forest opening as the A-Squad hunched down far enough away to not be seen to plan their next move.
