# Session 13

After a short wait in the master bedroom a group people arrived at Giantborn's mansion. Loud yelling revealed that Giantborn was talking to an high ranking officer of the Empire's Guards in the city. Because of the attempted assassination he demanded that protection should be supplied all high ranking representatives of the Empire in town. After having sent a soldier to carry out this command they retreated to the office.

Sensing an opportunity the group stormed the office to assassinate Giantborn, only to find that he was talking with Ulfgar Fireforge the leader of the Empire's guard. Grabbing the opportunity to mark two names of their list the group killed the two Dwarves, before grabbing Giantborn's dragonstone and making a swift escape out the window.

Knowing that the representatives of the Empire would soon have guards, the group decided to act quick and to take out another person of their list. They made a decision to go for Lorsuth Coinshaper the leader of the Trader's guild.

Using the dragonstone as leverage while pretending to be important traders the group was able to infiltrate the trader's guild and get Lorsuth Coinshaper alone. Even though Coinshaper fought valiantly, the group was too much for him.

Once again the group made a quick escape out a window and proceeded to escape down some side allys. During the escape the group was struck with a force from afar, once again it was Hans Clock. However this time Bakrus appeared to have grown more powerful, almost pulsating with raw energy. Using the power unlocked in the hammer Hans was almost able to bring the group to their knees before their numbers became too much and he was forced to retreat.

Exhausted the group decided to return back to the resistance hide out. On their way back the group was surprised to see a member of the empire's guard that seemed to be dressed in the same kind of gear as the soldier's they had encountered on their way to Slumberhaven. The group was however able to remain undetected from by the guard.

Back in the safe house Helm informed the group that he had been able to assassinate Umirdoid Trollhide the Representative of the Emperor's Mage tower. This combined with some diplomatic work that had been done was bringing the resistance closer to taking the town. If only they could bring a respected member of the town guard to their cause, the revolution would be ready.

However there was one complication, a group of empire's guards had arrived in town. Strengthening the Empire's position in the city. Helm was able to confirm that this group was the same group that had been chasing the A-Squad. The A-Squad agreed to take on the group that had arrived, in return Helm promised the group he would put out an bounty on Hans Clock.

At the Hole in the Wall the group discussed how to take out the Empire's guards chasing them. Eventually they decided to plan out a trap for them in the sewers, and spreading rumors to lure them. While they were making the plans a town guard started to harass a woman outside the restaurant. Unable to fight his instinct to protect the weak Edward unleashed a rain of arrows on the guard, killing him instantly.

Using the resistance influence the group was able to silence the onlookers and the group disposed of the body with the help of the owner of the Hole in the Wall, Vilnu Abune, who through this act pledged loyalty to the resistance.
