# Session 7

The book in question was the spell book of the old arch mage of the college. The A-Squad promptly departed and landed on the beach of the college after about an hour at seas, with gradually worsening weather. 

It quickly became apparent that reaching the college would not be a simple task, as it stood surrounded by treacherous cliffs. As the group searched for a better path to take they suddenly was bombarded by rocks, seemingly coming from no where. Pushing further towards the College through a less treacherous pathway, the origin of the bombardment became apparent as the group was attacked by two invisible forces. This place was indeed cursed.

Even in a fight against invisible attackers the A-Squad stood strong and came out victorious. Not far from the college they promptly pushed further, seeking refuge from the ever worsening weather.

A dry wall og dust and cobwebs greeted the group as they entered the college. As the group made their way through the college searching for the library they encountered ghostly echos, illusions repeating the moments the last moments before the college was cursed. Seemingly unaware of the world around them the echos posed no threat to the A-Squad, however some ghostly creatures seemingly aware of the world around them attacked them. These creatures where promptly dealt with.

The group pressed on until they arrived at a courtyard, seemingly used to receive guests arriving by teleportation. An echo appared showing a Paladin of the Emperor's guard arriving, having a heated discussion with an arch mage of the college before departing.

Behind the courtyard the group found the entrance to the library, making their way to the restricted area where they once again encountered an echo. This time the echo was of a hooded wizard taking a seemingly highly regarded book from its lectern. As the hooded echo turned around the group could clearly see that it was an echo of Aldaron 20 years younger. The echo disappeared into the distance, but left a faint glowing trail behind it. As the group followed the trail a ghost charged into Alvyn and disappeared, seemingly to no effect. Shortly after another ghost jumped the group unleashing a horrific scream that brought Emerald to his knees instantly. To add to the group's shock the Alvyn turned on the group striking them with his quartestaff, seemingly possessed.

Through quick thinking and some help from magic the group was able to bring Emerald back into fighting shape and releasing Alvyn from his possession. Once they had regrouped a fireball made short work of the ghosts.

The group continued further into the College, moving upwards towards the eastern side of the island. 

At the far side of the college they found a large ritual chamber overlooking the sea, on a lectern in the middle of the room the book from earlier. Upon entering the chamber an echo of a ritual performed appeared, Aldaron together with 4 other Wizards standing in a circle around 3 eldritch machines looking exactly like the one in the possession of the Hobgoblin illusionst. 

As the ritual continued the arch mage from earlier appeared through the room, angrily confronting Aldaron before starting to cast magic. But as he was about release the spell a sword pierced his chest from behind, as he fell to his death the paladin from the echo in the court yard stood behind him.

Suddenly ghosts appeared in the chamber and the A-squad was forced once again to fight for their lives. Though exhausting the fight proved to be no challenge to the group and as they cleared the room ritual started to draw to an end. As the ritual concluded the Paladin picked up the 3 eldritch machines and approached Aldaron, as they congratulated each other a black shape appeared over the dead arch mages echo. The black shape cursed at Aldaron and started to release a shadow spreading out across the room. The paladin activated an eldritch machine in his possession teleporting him and Aldaron away, barely avoiding the creeping shadow.

As the Paladin and Aldaron disappeared the echo died down, but the black shape remained. It promptly attacked the A-Squad, the group already weakened from day faught valiantly and brought the shadow down. As the shadow died it was as if an aura was lifted of the island, and the stormy weather started to lessen.

Exhausted from a day of fighting the A-Squad decided to return to town for a rest before confronting Aldaron with what they saw. However, as they were rowing back to town currents in the sea brought them to the shores of the lighthouse island.
