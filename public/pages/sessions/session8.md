# Session 8

The group slowly approached the lighthouse, weary of what was awaiting them. Inside the lighthouse they were once again met by Aldaron, this time he spoke to them from a balcony circling the lighthouse.

Aldaron explained to the group the nature of what they had seen in the college ruins. The echos depicted the leader of the emperor's guard approaching the wizards of the college at the end of the great war, to have them build an eldritch machine for the emperor. Archmage Elijah had refused, an act which would surely bring the wrath of the emperor upon the college. In exchange from having been promised the archmage position, and to save the college, Aldaron had promised to perform the ritual in Elijas place.

Elijah had refused to create the eldritch machine because the nature of the machine was questionable. The purpose of the machine was to collect the souls of anyone that died within titan's vale. This way the emperor wanted to defeat the Wild Races by stopping their widespread use of resurrection magic. However the machine would also collect the souls of the inhabitants of Titan's Vale trapping them forever.

After the war the emperor had refused to disable the machines, and they stayed on hidden within the temples of Kensington, Stonewood and Slumberhaven. The disabled eldritch machine in the possession of the Hobgoblin Illusionist was the one from Kensington, the peopled of kensington had been used in a blood ritual to disable that machine.

Now that one machine was disabled the range of the magic would be limited. If a second one would disabled they would no longer collect new souls. But to release the souls already collected the third machine would be have to be disabled.

Upon hearing this the group decided to collect and disable all the eldritch machines. The group asked whether Aldaron's alligiance laid with the emperor, Aldaron said that his motivation had always been a desire for knowledge. He thanked the group for collecting the book, as the curse of the college would stop him from entering the college. 

As the group gave the archmage's book of the college to Aldaron, he informed them that the emperor's guard had arrived in Slumberhaven looking for the A-Squad and that he would use the book to create a permanent teleportation circle that the could send the group to any major city in Titan's Vale whenever they wanted.

The group decided to use the teleportation circle to go to Fortunas the following morning and from there to move further on to Stonewood to collect the eldritch machine there.

As the group was about to depart the morning after, Aldaron gave the group a dragonstone and told the group this was his contribution to lift the curse of the land as he felt guilty about it.

The group teleported to Fortunas, a city unlike any other they had ever seen. And at the core a castle a creation unlike any other, its walls glowing of imbued dragonstone pained a image of the riches within the city walls of Fortunad. But with more pressing matters the group promtly departed, after a short time of debauchery, in direction of Stonewood where they were greeted as heroes.

After a night spent celebrated as heroes the group awoke to search the temple for the eldritch machine. By searching the temple for magic the group promptly found the machine hidden underneath the stone floor. A bright light flashed as the group introduced the dragonstone from Aldaron to the machine, and seconds later it laid disabled on the ground.

With the disabled machine in hand the group decided to depart Stonewood in the direction of Kensington, to search for evidence to clear their name. Upon leaving the temple Hans felt drawn to take out Bakrus, the hammer he had taken from the spider cave in Stonewood. The hammer glowed with renewed power as Hans was overwhelmed with visions of the Dwarf that had once carried the hammer. The visions requested once more that the hammer should be returned to his family home, the Brightshield Homestead.

On their way to Kensington the A-Squad entered into the swamps at the core of Titan's Vale. Not too far from Moldy Crossing the group encountered two guards, supicious of their behavior as they passed the group decided to investigate the guards from a distance. They were able to figure out that the guards had seen their faces on a wanted poster. In an effort to keep their location secret Hans Clock struck both guards down. After burrowing the guards in shallow graves the group continued on to moldy crossing where they spent the night.
