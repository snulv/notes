# Session 9

The group awoke to a commotion going on just beyond their chambers. Seeking out the commotion they learned that village was in distress, two guards had been missing since yesterday. The people of the village were convinced they had been attacked by a Black Dragon that plagues the area, and asked the A-Squad to take revenge on it.

Burdened by their conscience, knowing that the lives of the guards had been taken by them in a desperate attempt to cover their tracks, the A-Squad decided to rid the area of the black dragon. Hoping that it would bring them some sort of redemption.

While preparing for their hunt, the group learned that a Druid lived in the area. Hoping that he could help them, they sought him out. The druid refused to actively participate in slaying the dragon, as he viewed him as a part of the natural echo system. However, if the group would assist him in performing a ritual to cleanse a blight in the swamps he would help them with an enchantment and a means to find the dragon. 

After following the druid deeper into the swamp, they came upon what looked like a black tear in space. The group was tasked with guarding the druid as he performed the ritual to close the tear. As soon as he began creatures of the feywild was drawn to the interrupt ritual, but the A-Squad defeated them.

Using the left over magic from the successful ritual the druid enchanted the A-Squad with poison immunity. Further more he gave them a magic leaf that would guide them to the dragon. Following the leaf for several hours the group came upon a large lake. Convinced that the dragon was in the lake they set up bait to lure him out.

The bait proved successful and the dragon emerged from the depth of the lake to shower the group in it's acid breath attack. The enchantment proved effective as the group fought on, seemingly unaffected by the acid. The group latched on to the dragon to fight it in the air and deprived of it's most powerful weapon the Dragon proved to be no match for the group.

After their successful dragon hunt the A-Squad returned to Moldy Crossing
