# Session 12

After a night spent in the safe house Helm Graycastle also arrived there. He informed the A-Squad that their mission had been a success. However on their back they had been ambushed by Marblebreaker that had taken captured Varis Na√Ølo and that he was to be set up for execution this afternoon.

Through discussion with Graycastle the group was informed about key people and factions that would either have to be taken out or brought into the resistance for a revolution to take the town would be successful. The group decided that the best place to start would be to assassinate the leader of the Dwarven nobles in the town.

In an attempt to locate the leader, Thergrumlin Giantborn, the group located and scouted his house. The information they collected lead them to believe he was not there, and the group decided to head to the execution of Varis. Believing that the nobles likely would be there.

Their hunch turned out to be true, the nobles where at the execution grounds. The group thought this could be a good chance to assassinate Giantborn through poisoning his drink. To this end Lewis disguised himself as a servant and infiltrated area of the nobles. Everything seemed to go smoothly until Lewis fumbled on poring the poison into the glass, drawing the attention of some nearby guards.

Through quick thinking of Edward, Lewis was easily able to loose the attention of the guards. However they needed to evacuate the area and their mission had failed. To attempt to salvage the situation, the group decided to infiltrate the house of Giantborn to set a trap for him. 

Sneaking past the guard turned out to be no problem for a group as experienced as the A-Squad, and they were able to scout the house with relatively little resistance. In the house the group stumbled upon a Dragonstone of a size unlike any they had seen before, large enough to be used to disable the finale eldritch machine once it had been shaped. However the group decided to leave the stone alone until after they had assassinated Giantborn.

Once the group found a chamber that seemed like a master bedroom they decided hide and await their pray.
