# Session 3

 While planning the A-Squad noticed a scouting group rotating the area, promptly dispatching with the group. The A-Squad stole the groups identity and infiltrated the camp. After gathering information for a while the group was able to figure out that the Bandits were celebrating that they had been hired by a blong person named Anton to assassinate someone named John Parsons. After having found the Satyr's Camembert the group departed.

On their way back to Stonewood the A Squad returned the Camembert to the Satyr before getting into combat with 3 Brown Bears. Upon returning to Stonewood the group approached the leader of the guard to report what they had heard. The leader of the guard turned out to be John Parsons. John Parsons was slightly suspicious of the group, saying that he doubth that Anton Miller would do this. However if someone were to assassinate him it would make sense that they would do it tomorrow when a meeting between him, Anton Miller and Henry Wheatfallow was planned just outside town.

John Parsons allowed the group to return to the tavern for a rest, but said to come meet him again tomorrow morning.
