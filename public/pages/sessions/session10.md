# Session 10

After a night's sleep the A-Squad continued their journey to Kensington. Traveling through the swamp was tiring but uneventful, and the group arrived outside Kensington in the evening. Exhausted they decided to rest and scout the town from afar and investigate further in the morning.

The night was uneventful and the group made their way through the abandoned city towards the cathedral, passing by the stench of composing food still laying the out in the kiosks of the market square. Upon reaching the cathedral steps it became clear that powerful and foul magic still remained inside. The true nature of this magic was however obscured by a door made of shadow.

Beyond the shadow door laid a cathedral in ruins with the remnants of a Blood Magic Ritual in the center of the main chamber. Circles of dead bodies in various levels of decay surrounding ritual markings, clearly written in the language of the wild races. Like any sensible person the A-team decided to leave this place in a hurry, leaving the ritual untouched. But one thing were clear, there is no way that anyone investigating this would come to the conclusion that this was the work of the A-Squad. Leaving the only option that the A-Team is scape goats, and that proving their innocent may not be enough to stop the Emperor's Guard.

Heavy at heart the group continued their journey towards Westwend, traveling through the forest so as to make tracking them harder. With the exception of a detour, an encounter with some Satyrs and a run in with some Wolves the journey was unremarkable and the group arrived in Westwend the following afternoon.

Upon approaching Westwend the grout contacted Filibert Silentfoot, arranging to meet him later in the tavern closest to the Chapel. In the mean time the group spend their time getting to know the city, learning about the existence of the Arcanist's Roundtable. A meeting place for anyone with an interest in the arcane. Be it magic items, arcane training or research, the Arcanist's Roundtable would be the place to seek out.

Looking for a place to purchase Dragonstone the A-Team headed to the Arcanist's Roundtable. There they asked for a Dragonstone of equal quality to the one they had used to disable the Eldritch Macine of Stonewood. The people of the Arcanist's Roundtable seemed almost in shock at such a request, and after some discussion it became clear that the cost of such a stone would be way beyond what the group could afford. As an alternative, Alvyn Nackle inquired if he could not train so that he could craft such an item himself. The Arcanists of the Roundtable accepted the suggestion for a price, but added that creating such an item would require a very specialized equipment. His training would start tomorrow and since Alwyn is already experienced in Arcane Craftind id would require only five days.

The group made their way to the tavern closest to the Chapel, as it turns out the chapel is the nicer part of town. And the tavern is a meeting place for nobles and dwarven emissaries. Even though they felt at risk in such a location the group decided to wait for Filibert. Luckily the group did not have to wait long as Filibert arrived shortly after. 

Filibert seemed unsurprised to hear what the group had to say about their current situation, expressing the sentiment that perhaps now they understand the reality of the political landscape and the evils of the emperor. Through discussion it became clear that Filibert might be working with an organization that opposes the status quo.

Afraid to continue the discussion in the tavern, Filibert asked the group to follow them to a safe place. He lead them to an sewer entrance by the river, here they encountered two other people of the same organization as Filibert. They asked the group to be blindfolded as they led them to their hide out. The group walked blindfolded through a maze like sewer before arriving at their destination.

As the blindfolds came off the group was standing in a circular chamber, in front of them two people a middle aged human and a noble looking elf. The human introduced himself as Helm Graycastle, the leader of the resistance. After a short talk he presented the A-Squad with a choice, join the resistance and fight for the freedom of Titan's Vale. Graycastle gave the A-Squad one night of sleep in their safe house to think about it, if they should decide not to join them he personally guaranteed they would be allowed to leave unharmed.

The A-Squad retired to discuss their choice and to rest.
