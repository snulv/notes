# Session 15

The day before the revolution Helm talked with the group to explain their part in the coming event. The resistance would be taking several strategic positions within Westwend. None more important than the Castle Barracks, the seat of power and training ground of the Empire's Guard in Westwend.

Helm tasked the A-Squad with leading the charge into the Castle Barracks, with two missions being the most important. First they would have to take the gate house of the outer wall, so that the resistance could ensure that the Castle Barracks could not be a safe house for the people loyal to the Empire.

Second they would have to eliminate Marblebreaker, as he was the final high ranking representative of the Empire. Eliminating him would deal a great blow to the remaining soldiers, which would in turn give the resistance control of the town.

On the morning of the revolution the A-Squad discussed how to take the gate house. They decided that the best course of action would to have Emerald use a potion of Etherealness to walk through the wall while the rest of the group would fly over the wall and sneak in from behind.

Thanks to their plan and Edward's Pass without trace, the group was able to enter the Gatehouse without being detected. While Emerald was still ethereal, he scouted the main chamber of the gate house. Showing a group of 5 people, the group decided to use a distraction to get and advantage on the people within the chamber.

Lewis used an illusory dog to draw the attention of the guards while Alvyn unleashed a fireball on them. During the ensuing battle the group noticed that Marblebreaker was also in the room. But due to the element of surprise Marblebreaker was forced to retreat further into the castle barracks, leaving the gatehouse in the hands of the group. The group opened the outer door to let in the resistance before giving chase to Marblebreaker.
 
The chase led to the courtyard, an area surrounding the inner castle used for training. Through a arrow slit halfway up the castle the group could see Marblebreaker, and they quickly decided to make their way into the castle. However between them and their goal 4 guards dressed in charcoal black armors and a large wooden door blocking the castle entrance.

Lewis cast a spell of hypnotize on the guards, putting them to sleep, as Edward laid down a fog between them and the castle door. Allowing them to get to the door without further problems. Upon reaching the wall they were out of sight of Marblebreaker's arrows, however they were surprised by the sound of an airship flying above them. The airship unleashed an inferno of flame on the group, waking the sleeping guards.

Being forced to fight the guards by the door, and fearing another inferno from the airship, prompted Alvyn and Emerpald to misty step through the door. On the other side they could easily open the door and let the rest of the group enter, shutting the door behind them so that the guards were left outside.

The first room inside the castle turned out to be an Aarkocra arial training chamber. A great circular room leading all the way to the roof with a staircase in a spiral following the walls of the room leading all the way to the roof.

Just under the roof the A-Squad say Marblebreaker lighting a barrel and dropping it all the way down to the floor where it exploded. This way igniting the entire room, before Marblebreaker escaped to the roof. The group started to chase marble breaker but was forced to fight some Aaracokra while they climbed the stairs. The fight was close bringing Edward down, but thanks do a heal and a polymorph into a giant ape he was brought back to life turning the tide of the battle. Once Emerald brought one of the Aarakocra down using an entangling arrow the battle was over and the group escaped the burning room onto the roof.

On the roof they were met with Marblebreaker escaping into the airship. Emerald and Alice boarded the ship using an magically enhanced jump and flying boots respectively. Leaving a Giant Age, Lewis and Alvyn remaining with only one broom. Suddenly Alvyn remembered that he had a scroll of fly, handing over his broom stick Lewis as he cast fly on Edward the Ape. Just before the Ape took flight Alvyn yelled "Throw me" and the ape obliged, throwing Alvyn across the gap onto the Airship.

Once in the Airship they were immediately met with with an onslaught by Marblebreaker. Marblebreaker fought with might and through the use of arial maneuvers they were able to throw Alice out the ship, leaving here behind flying without anyway to catch up. Finally the group brought down Marblebreaker, but with his final energy he killed the pilot of the ship.

The ship begun to decent as Alvyn immediately jumped into the pilot seat and attempted to slow their decent. Through the help of Lewis they were able to bring the airship in for a relatively safe landing.

At the end of the fights the resistance had won, Westwend were there's. The Heroes of the A-Squad was duly awarded before taking a well deserved rest.
